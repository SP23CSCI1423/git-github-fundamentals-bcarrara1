Q1. strong vs loosely typed 
strong typing is when you have to be very spacific in what the varable is 
and loosely typed is when you dont have to be so spacific in the varable 
for an example for strongly typed is when you make a varible and name is $burger you have to use that exact wording that goes with it to
and for more loose varables is when you have a hash and you type in your for loop to get all your keys out you don't have to type all you keys and values out

Q2. the three data types would be arrays hashs and varables
varables you have one key and one value
for arrays you have multiple key things that can be printed out
and you have hashs that can print out the keys and values that is put into it and it is infinate 

Q3. an iif statement is not a loop becuase it is conditions inside a loop that that code has to fallow to the letter

Q4.stack is when multiple things are going on at once and all doing diffrent things
queue is when things are in order and most likely relates to one another
